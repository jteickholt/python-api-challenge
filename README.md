# python-api-challenge

### This project explores the use of API's in Python.  In particular, it generates a list of 500+ randome latitudes and longitiues, then uses the citypy API to find the nearest city.  They city is then passed to the OpenWeather API to obtain current weather conditions (ie. temp, humidty, wind, etc.). Some further analysis is then done using the weather data and several visualisations are created.
